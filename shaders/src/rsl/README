Here are all original shader sources that we use.

WoodShader.cpp : wood.sl

WhittedShader.cpp : whitted.sl

  Code is directly from RenderMan specification.

StarballShader.cpp : starball.sl

  starball.sl includes material.h, which includes other headers,
  however only MaterialPlastic function from material.h is used which is
  self-contained.

StarballGlassShader.cpp : starball.sl + glass.sl

  StarballGlassShader is a combination of starball.sl and glass.sl so there
  is no original RSL source code.

ScreenAA.cpp : screen_aa.sl

  Only the commented, not anti-aliased part of the shader is used:
  /* This would be the non-antialiased version:
   *    w = step (GWF,ss) - step(1-GWF,ss);
   *    h = step (GWF,tt) - step(1-GWF,tt);
   */

ReflectiveParquetPlankShader.cpp : parquet_plank.sl + reflection with fresnel term

PhongShader.cpp : seems to be not RenderMan-based

NormalShader.cpp : not RenderMan-based, just returns normal as color

MirrorShader.cpp : not RenderMan-based, just do perfect mirror

MandelbrotShader.cpp : Simon's mandelbrot shader

GraniteShader.cpp : granite.sl

GlassShader.cpp : glass.sl

DepthShader.cpp : not RenderMan-based, just returns hit distance as color

DentedShader.cpp : dented.sl

CheckerShader.cpp : checker.sl

CheckerReflectiveShader.cpp : checker.sl + reflective ray

BrickShader.cpp : brick.sl

ApiShader.cpp : not RenderMan-based

AlphaShader.cpp : not RenderMan-based
